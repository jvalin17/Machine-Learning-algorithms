Question 1 Homework 3

Files:

Ds - set of records given in homework document
Du - set of unlabeled records given in homework document
Dt - set of test records given in homework document


ml3_Ds.csv - Ds

ML_p3.csv -Ds

MLp.csv -Ds

test_ml3.csv - Du

ml3_2.csv - Dt

ml3_Ds, ML_p3, MLp have same content but two of the files get updated in one of the code and all files are used so there are 3 differently named same files. 

Part a:

Input : 'ML_p3.csv'
Program Name: MLP3.py
Language: Python 

Self Training Semi Supervised Learning Algorithm

It takes input from ML_p3.csv and runs self training logistic regression on it. So it updates the input file when it adds unlabeled data in it.

So if you want to implement the code again (more than once) ,clear the data from input file that is ML_p3.csv and you need to copy all rows from
ml3_Ds.csv and paste the rows in input file. 


Part b:

Program Name: mlP3.2.py


Naive Bayes Classifier
Input : 'ml3_Ds.csv'

Language: Python


It just takes input from the input file and tests the results on ml3_2.csv which is Dt in the given homework document. the accuracy is calculted in the 
program itself.

Semi-supervised Learning: Self Training Logistic Algorithm (Same code as above) 
Input: 'MLp.csv'


It takes input from input file an d applies the algorithm same as described above and it has same limitation if you want to run it again.

At the end accuracy from both classifiers are printed on screen.
