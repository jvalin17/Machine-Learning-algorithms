Decision Tree
There is a image of fully grown decision tree.
Numpy is used to load the data into a matrix.
There are two files. Training data is mu_train.csv in which last column has been eliminated.
It has been tested on mu_tst.csv.


For ensemble classifier:
I have made 2 files ensemble1.csv and ensemble2.csv based on random data points from mu_train.csv.
First it is trained on ensemble1.csv and checked for ensemble2.csv and then vice versa.
The accuracy of both is printing.
