### Problem Statement: Predict gender of a person given age,weight and height using visualization of regression models .

#### Program Name:  ML_1(Training)
Linear Regression  

I have written program in python to get input from user for degree/order of equation as required. I have provided alpha i.e. 
learning rate as 0.03 (r in program) which can be changed as per requirement. It plots the curves in 3d space. The color bar in the
graph represents value of prediction by the program. The other two axes are x1 and x2 values.

#### Test Data: ML_1(Test)

#### Libraries
numpy - to take input and especially to do matrix calculations.  
mpl_toolkits.mplot3d , matplotlib - to plot 3D graphs 

#### Program Name: ML_P2
It is logistic regression on the same data. The accuracies are better at higher learning rate.
